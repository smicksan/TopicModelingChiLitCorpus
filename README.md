## Introduction

The aim of this project is to train a **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** model to analyze and understand the **topics** in the **ChiLit Corpus** from [mahlberg-lab/corpora](https://github.com/mahlberg-lab/corpora/tree/a020b2a7153baf8849056be833861ecb3d77e7a1/ChiLit).

A key research question during model training was:  
**What is the ideal number of topics?**  
The goal was to find a balance between **not too many fine-grained topics** and **not too few overly broad topics**.

## ChiLit Corpus Description

The **ChiLit Corpus** is used in this notebook.  
The corpus can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mahlberg-lab/corpora/tree/a020b2a7153baf8849056be833861ecb3d77e7a1/ChiLit).

Additionally, a **notebook** is available for **preprocessing** the corpus.

## Corpus Statistics

| **Metric**                 | **Unprocessed Files** | **Processed Files** | **Why the Change?**                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Words (Tokens)**   | 5,404,761             | 2,191,892           | Stopwords & punctuation removed                      |
| **Unique Words (Tokens)**  | 70,728                | 51,673              | Slight reduction, but more meaningful words remain   |
| **Lexical Richness**       | 0.0131                | 0.0236              | Fewer redundant words, unique word ratio increased   |

## Topic Modeling with OCTIS

This project utilizes [OCTIS (Optimized Configuration of Topic Models)](https://github.com/MIND-Lab/OCTIS/blob/master/README.rst?plain=1), a **Python library** designed to facilitate **topic model training and evaluation**.

### OCTIS provides:
- **Preprocessing tools** to clean and prepare text data.
- **Multiple topic modeling algorithms**, including:
  - **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
  - **ProdLDA (Product of Experts LDA)**
  - **ETM (Embedded Topic Model)**
- **Evaluation metrics** such as:
  - **Topic Diversity**
  - **Topic Coherence**
- **Hyperparameter optimization** for tuning the number of topics.
